## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- SASS compiler
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow
- JavaScript

### Continued development

I feel like I'm improving my skills, but I have a lot of word to do. I still want to be able to build a full application handling back-end too. Keep practicing my fron-end skills. That's it.

### Useful resources

- [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/chat) - This helped a lot building pieces of code that I wasn't sure. Awesome tool.
